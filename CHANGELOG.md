## 1.1.0

### :bangbang: Breaking changes

Removed `mapActions` from `useRj` (was the last argument).

To rename actions simply use object deconstructing, from:
```js
const [state, { fetchStuff } = useRj(
  MaRjState,
  undefined,
  actions => ({ fetchStuff: actions.run })
)
```
To:
```js
const [state, { run: fetchStuff } = useRj(MaRjState)
```

For a deep discussion of why this option was removed see: https://github.com/inmagik/react-rocketjump/issues/12

### :zap: New features

#### `useRunRj`

Use a rocketjump object and run it using `useEffect` according to `deps`, all `deps` are passed to `run` function.

This is a simple syntactic sugar over `useRj`, you can implement it by yourself:
https://inmagik.github.io/react-rocketjump/docs/tips_and_tricks

If you have a `rocketjump` with easy-trigger-deps you can use `useRunRj` to write less code.

These pieces of codes do the same.

Without `useRunRj()`:

```js
const [{ data: product }, { run: fetchProduct, clean: cleanProduct }] = useRj(MaRjState)
useEffect(() => {
  fetchProduct(productId)
  return () => {
    cleanProduct()
  }
}, [fetchProduct, cleanProduct, productId])
```

With `useRunRj`:
```js
const [{ data: product }] = useRunRj(
  MaRjState,
  [productId], // <- Deps
  true, // <- Should clean on new effect? default to true
)
```

You can find documentation about `useRunRj` here: https://inmagik.github.io/react-rocketjump/docs/api_connect#userunrj

#### `computed` :heart:

Now `rj` has a new config option: `computed`.

`computed` is expected to be an object that maps from a computed property name to a selector name.

When a `rj` in the recursion chain "enables" `computed`, the state returned from `useRj` or `connectRj`
is computed according to this configuration, otherwise the default structure is returned. `computed` declarations are merged using the normal `rj` recursion order.

The `computed` mapping is unique, so you can't bind a selector multiple times. If you do this, the last bindings wins.

Example:

```js

const MaRjState = rj(
  rj({
    computed: {
      secret: 'getSecret',
      ohShit: 'getError',
    },
    selectors: () => ({
      getSecret: () => 23,
    })
  }, {
    effect: myEffect,
    computed: {
      todos: 'getData',
      error: 'getError',
    }
  })
)

const [state, actions] = useRj(MaRjState)

```

The value of state is:

```js
{
  error: null, // state.error
  secret: 23, 
  todos: null, // state.data
}
```

#### `plugins/list`

Now the plugin list use `computed` to avoid mapping the same state over and over again.

A new selector `getPagination` is exposed, returning an Object with all the pagination info.

The computed config privided by the plugin is:
(you can completely change this config writing your own `computed` config):
```js
{
  error: 'getError',
  loading: 'isLoading',
  list: 'getList',
  pagination: 'getPagination',
}
```
