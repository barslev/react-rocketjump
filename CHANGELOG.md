## 2.0.0
###### *?*

This release not contains breaking changes, but introduce a lot a new features, awesome stuff, some performance improvments and improve the rj stability.

#### `mutations` :broken_heart: :fire: :metal:
The main great feature of rj v2 is mutations.

Mutations add an additional option to the rj config oject called `mutations` (only allowed in the last config object at the same level of `effect`), where you have to configured your mutations behaviours.

What is a mutation?

A mutation is simply an effect that when success update the root rj state with its result.

Ok, for example take a normal rj to fetch some todos from an api.

```js
const MaTodosState = rj({
  effect: () => fetch(`/todos`).then(r => r.json()),
})
```
Now you want to toggle your todo with using api like *PATCH* `/todos/${id}`, you can write a mutation for that:
```js
const MaTodosState = rj({
  mutations: {
    toggleTodo:{
      // The effect to perform accept the same values of rj effect () => Promise|Observable
      effect: todo => fetch(`/todos/${todo.id}`, {
         method: 'PATCH',
         body: { done: !todo.done }
      }).then(r => r.json()),
      // A PURE function to update the main rj state called when the effect resolves|complete.
      // (prevState, effectResult) => nextState
      updater: (state, updatedTodo) => ({
        ...state,
        data: state.data.map(todo => todo.id === updatedTodo ? updatedTodo : todo),
      })
    } 
  }
  effect: () => fetch(`/todos`).then(r => r.json()),
})
```
Yeah you have writed your first mutation!

Ok, but how can i use mutations? 

For every mutation config rj add an action creator, using the keys as names, to the action creators exported.

Theese action creators trigger the `effect` defined in the corresponding mutation and when the effect succeded use the corresponding `updater` to update the state.

Mutations action creators are effect actions and have the Builder as well.

Mutations action creators are supported for all the React bindings `useRj`, `useRunRj` and `connectRj`.

If the mutation name overwrite a preexisting action creator rj print a warn in DEV.

So for example this a dub react component to toggle some todos using our RjObject:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { useRunRj } from 'react-rocketjump'
import { MaTodosState } from './localstate'

function MaTodos() {
  const [{ data: todos }, { toggleTodo }] = useRunRj(MaTodosState)
  
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos && todos.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo.id} onClick={() => toggleTodo(todo)}>
          {todo.title}{' '}{todo.done ? 'âˆš' : ''}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

#### `logger` :smiling_imp:

Yess, a [redux-logger](https://github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger) like logger for rj.

Why a logger? Because as the grow of use of rj becames difficult to tracks and debug all the effects and the rjs state updateds. 

Yes and some of us miss a tools like redux logger or redux dev tools.

Yess, yess, yess the React dev tools especially the new version is AWESOME but this logger help you understand if your rj configuration and effects flows works as you want.

This is what's look like:

## 1.2.0
###### *September 4, 2019*

### :bangbang: Breaking changes

Changed how `<ConfigureRj />` works.

Before `effectCaller` in `<ConfigureRj />` will replace the rj `effectCaller` unless you explicit define them in rj configuration.

This behavior was not enough flexible, so we introduced the ability of rj configuration to be lazy, for now we apply them only to `effectCaller` config option.

Now when you define the `effectcaller` in `<ConfigureRj />` you enable a lazy configuration value.
Later when you define your rjs you can refer to them in your configuration, using the speical syntax `rj.configured()`.

When rj encounter the special `rj.configured()` the configuration option will become lazy and the recursion will execute when rj mounts and have access to `<ConfigureRj />` context.

Thanks to this you can place your configured `effectCaller` where do you want in the recursion chain:

```js
<ConfigureRj effectCaller={myCustomEffectCaller}>
    /* This is the scope where the lazy effect caller is enabled */
</ConfigureRj>
```

```js
rj(
  {
    effectCaller: myEffectCallerA,
    // ... rj config ...
  }
  {
    effectCaller: rj.configured(),
    // ... rj config ...
  },
  {
    effectCaller: myEffectCallerB,
    // ... rj config ...
  }
)
```

## 1.1.0
###### *July 16, 2019*

### :bangbang: Breaking changes

Removed `mapActions` from `useRj` (was the last argument).

To rename actions simply use object deconstructing, from:
```js
const [state, { fetchStuff } = useRj(
  MaRjState,
  undefined,
  actions => ({ fetchStuff: actions.run })
)
```
To:
```js
const [state, { run: fetchStuff } = useRj(MaRjState)
```

For a deep discussion of why this option was removed see: https://github.com/inmagik/react-rocketjump/issues/12

### :zap: New features

#### `useRunRj`

Use a rocketjump object and run it using `useEffect` according to `deps`, all `deps` are passed to `run` function.

This is a simple syntactic sugar over `useRj`, you can implement it by yourself:
https://inmagik.github.io/react-rocketjump/docs/tips_and_tricks

If you have a `rocketjump` with easy-trigger-deps you can use `useRunRj` to write less code.

These pieces of codes do the same.

Without `useRunRj()`:

```js
const [{ data: product }, { run: fetchProduct, clean: cleanProduct }] = useRj(MaRjState)
useEffect(() => {
  fetchProduct(productId)
  return () => {
    cleanProduct()
  }
}, [fetchProduct, cleanProduct, productId])
```

With `useRunRj`:
```js
const [{ data: product }] = useRunRj(
  MaRjState,
  [productId], // <- Deps
  true, // <- Should clean on new effect? default to true
)
```

You can find documentation about `useRunRj` here: https://inmagik.github.io/react-rocketjump/docs/api_connect#userunrj

#### `computed` :heart:

Now `rj` has a new config option: `computed`.

`computed` is expected to be an object that maps from a computed property name to a selector name.

When a `rj` in the recursion chain "enables" `computed`, the state returned from `useRj` or `connectRj`
is computed according to this configuration, otherwise the default structure is returned. `computed` declarations are merged using the normal `rj` recursion order.

The `computed` mapping is unique, so you can't bind a selector multiple times. If you do this, the last bindings wins.

Example:

```js

const MaRjState = rj(
  rj({
    computed: {
      secret: 'getSecret',
      ohShit: 'getError',
    },
    selectors: () => ({
      getSecret: () => 23,
    })
  }, {
    effect: myEffect,
    computed: {
      todos: 'getData',
      error: 'getError',
    }
  })
)

const [state, actions] = useRj(MaRjState)

```

The value of state is:

```js
{
  error: null, // state.error
  secret: 23, 
  todos: null, // state.data
}
```

#### `plugins/list`

Now the plugin list use `computed` to avoid mapping the same state over and over again.

A new selector `getPagination` is exposed, returning an Object with all the pagination info.

The computed config privided by the plugin is:
(you can completely change this config writing your own `computed` config):
```js
{
  error: 'getError',
  loading: 'isLoading',
  list: 'getList',
  pagination: 'getPagination',
}
```
