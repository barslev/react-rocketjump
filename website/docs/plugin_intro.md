React RocketJump ships with a set of plugins that can be used as out of the box solutions for common tasks.

If you are looking for how to write plugins check this [section](plugin_system.md).

We recommend you to read the documentation of the plugin(s) you are interested in to know more about the services it can offer and how to use it.


The following plugins are available out of the box:

<!-- - [List Plugin](plugin_list.md): tools for managing paginated state
- [PlainList Plugin](plugin_plain_list.md): tools for managing list-based state
- [ListInsert Plugin](plugin_list_insert.md): tools for easing out insertion of items in a list
- [ListUpdate Plugin](plugin_list_update.md): tools for easing out updating operations on the items of a list
- [ListDelete Plugin](plugin_list_delete.md): tools for managing deletions of items from a list
- [Map Plugin](plugin_map.md): tools for organizing state like a map of substates
- [Cache Plugin](plugin_cache.md): tools for caching task outputs and avoid repeating invocations -->
